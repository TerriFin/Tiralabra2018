# What did i do this week?

Optimized labyrinth drawing so that it only updates needed nodes, along with other minor upgrades/optimizations.
Also added depth search and A* search, and their respective counters.


# How has the program advanced?

Very well, soon i am going to be done on the programming side, and can do rest of the documentation and maybe even make alternative labyrinth generation algorithms!


# What did i learn this week?

How a proper A* works (first i tried to create it from memory, but it did not always find optimal path and i had to look it up)


# What parts are not clear?

Everything is pretty clear


# What am i going to do next?

Next i am going to create and implement my own data-structures to replace the ready made ones by java, after that i am technically done on the coding side, but there are still some changes i want to make.
