# What did i do this week?

I created heap and implemented it into the A* algorithm, added minor UI improvements that should prevent invalid values from breaking the program.


# How has the program advanced?

The program is now basically done, i should rework the way the algorithms are being calculated (currently every step is calculated when animator calls it, should be calculated in advance to prevent lag)


# What did i learn this week?

How a heap works. It was my second time making one, but it is crazy how fast you forget the details.


# What parts are not clear?

Nothing.


# What am i going to do next?

Same things i was going to do a week ago, plus optimizing the animation so that it does not lag (if i have time/motivation)


## Total time spent on this project this week;
