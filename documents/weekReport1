# What have i done this week?

Decided topic and made some documents explaining it. Also started thinking about implementation.


# How has the program advanced?

Literally not one step since i have not started making it yet.


# What did i learn this week?

Alot about gradle from other course, Also started thinking about labyrinth generation algorithms and how stupid my current idea is but how i still want to make it just to see how bad it is.


# What is unclear?

Mechanically i know what i am supposed to do; make a gradle project, write some code and tests for it and document it all, but i currently need to learn to use javafx again and last time i used it

i somehow got it working, but i made it in some stupid way that required exponentionally more work every time i added a new window, this project is not going to have multiple windows, but javafx

is still in my opinion the most unclear/intimidating part of this project.


# What am i going to do next?

On the code side i want my program to open a javafx window that has a canvas in it, along with a button and room for the results. After that i want the canvas to have squares and take in a two-dimensional array,

and if the array has at some point number 1 instead of 0, that square is painted black. After that i am going to either make a simple (stupid) labyrinth generation method and make it generate a new labyrinth when 

the button is pressed, or else i am going to start working on the pathfinding algorithms.
