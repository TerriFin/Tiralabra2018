#What did i do this week?

The gui, labyrinth generation, animation and its handlers (that required alot of trial and error) and first algorithm animated.
Basically the programs skeleton is now complete, and even though it is incredibly inefficient i am still proud of myself.


#How has the program advanced?

All program functionalities were made this week.


#What did i learn this week?

Got reminded how static classes work, that you should not try to use Thread.sleep or any other way to handle animation in javafx just because you dont feel like using timelines, and other minor stuff.


#What parts are not clear?

Do i have to use my own data-structures in labyrinth generation too? It would require me to create a couple more and the generation really is not the vocal point of this project.
Also, you can use arrays, right?

#What am i going to do next?

I am gonna add the other algorithms, and after that i am gonna make them function with data-structures i have written. After that i am done, but if i have some extra motivation i could upgrade the 
labyrinth generation to be more interesting/efficient


##Total time spent on this project this week;
#Approx 12 hours
*Mostly spent on trial and error relating to animation and gui*
